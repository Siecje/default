##Default

This is the boilerplate I use for every new project I start. I use [BassCSS](http://www.basscss.com/) by JxnBlk in every single project, so it's included in this.

####Usage

This is what I do:

```bash
$ mkdir newprojectname && cd newprojectname
$ git clone https://github.com/bentranter/default.git
$ subl ./
```

I'll update the versions of BassCSS as they get released.
